        <p class="question">Do older contestants have more votes cast against them?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            While from a glance it looks like there is no discrimination against older individuals, with
            the number of votes against being about the same if not lower than the amount of votes against
            younger individuals, the amount of total votes against a contestant is the total number of votes
            that were cast against them their entire run in the game (before being voted out or making it to
            the final). Therefore, if bias against older contestants was present, they would be voted out
            early, and the number of votes against them would be low.
            This visualization indicates to us that age does play some part in one's success as a contestant,
            with older individuals generally not being as successful as younger individuals.

        <p class="question">Design choices: </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Choice of color scheme: I chose green, as it goes with the theme of Survivor. <br>
            Marks and channels: The only mark in this visualization are points (the circles). The channels
            included are horizontal position and vertical position. <br>
            Other: I chose to make the points slightly transparent because lots of points overlapped, so I
            wanted to make sure the trends were accurately represented.

        <p class="question">Do contestants of a certain personality type tend to be more successful?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            It does look like contestants with certain personality types do tend to be more successful. ISFP and
            ESFP are tied for having the most individuals that made it to the jury - which generally means the
            contestant made it at least halfway through before being voted out. It also looks like extroverted
            personalities tend to make it farther, which make sense, as Survivor is largely a social game based on
            your ability to form and maintain relationships with the other contestants.

            Marks and channels: The only mark in this visualization are the figures of people. The channels included
            are horizontal position and vertical position. <br>
            Other: I chose to flip the x and y axes, because it is easier to visualize the pictogram when the figures
            are next to each other instead of on top of each other. I also chose to add a sorting feature to this 
            visualization because I thought it would be easier to observe the trends this way.

        <p class="question">How does gender and race factor into success on the show?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            Taking into account the gender breakdown of each season, there is no obvious discrimination against one gender.
            Similarly, taking into account the racial breakdown of each season, there is no obvious discrimination against
            whites or contestants of color. Seasons 13 and 14 were especially diverse, with the cast in both seasons having
            equal amounts of Asian-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and European-Americans. 
        </p>
        <p class="question">Design choices: </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Choice of color scheme: For gender, I chose the general colors associated with each group - blue for males, pink
            for females, and yellow for other. For race, I also followed this, choosing a lighter color for white contestants
            and a darker color for contestants of color. For the plot with both, I just mixed the corresponding colors (for 
            example, mixed blue and light brown for a white male) to get the resulting color for each group. I chose to do this
            because I thought it would make it easier for the viewer to look at the graph and not have to constantly refer back
            to the legend to see what color corresponded with which group. <br>
            Marks and channels: The marks are lines, which are each of the bars. The channels are horizontal position, vertical
            position, size (length), and color. <br>
            Other: I chose to break this visualization down by season because each season has a different cast demographic. I
            also chose to have three visualizations to see the breakdowns in more detail.

        <p class="question">Where are winning players typically from?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            The state with the most winners is California, followed by New York and Pennsylvania. This makes sense, as
            California has a large population.

        <p class="question">Design choices: </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Choice of color scheme: Again, I chose green, as it goes with the theme of Survivor. I chose to have the color get
            darker the more winners there were because it follows the human natural concept of darker meaning denser, or having
            more people. <br>
            Marks and channels: The marks are areas, which are each of the states. The channel is color. <br>
            Other: I used a tooltip to see the value for each state when hovering over it in order to remove any ambiguity
            that could arise due to the color gradient.

        <p class="question">Are contestants that vote “correctly” typically the ones who win at the end?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            It is true that contestants who win or make it to the final tend to have more correct votes than those who not,
            however, if someone is voted out earlier in the game, there is no opportunity for them to make any more votes, 
            correct or incorrect. This visualization is better suited to look at the correct votes between the winner and runner
            up(s), between which there is not much difference. 
        </p>
        <p class="question">Design choices: </p>
        <p class="answer">
            Choice of color scheme: Again, I chose green, as it goes with the theme of Survivor. I chose a lighter green for 
            the box plot itself, and a darker green with some transparency for the points on top to distinguish the two. <br>
            Marks and channels: The marks are circles, lines, and areas. The channels are horizontal position, vertical position,
            and size (length). <br>
            Other: I chose to display the individual points along with the box plot because I thought it would be helpful to
            see where the actual contestants lie, as sometimes the box plot can be slightly misleading.

        <span>Conclusion</span>
        <p class="answer">
            We can conclude that while there are inherent characteristics, such as age and personality type, that could affect a
            contestant's success on Survivor, in general, contestants are successful because of the way that they play the game. 
            Each winner's success cannot be attributed to factors such as gender or age or where they're from, but rather, more 
            intricate factors including their gameplay, luck, and their relationships with other contestants.
